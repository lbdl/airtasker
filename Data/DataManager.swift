/// The data manager is intended to be passed between view controllers as a data handler

/// This implementation also makes no considerations of authentication etc although
/// the data manager should handle all of this as per the servers requirements internally
/// and in an opaque manner as far as the consumers of the manager are concerned
///
/// A view controller should not need to know anything about it other
/// than to call the methods it needs as defined in the DataController protocol.
///
/// Data fetched is stored in CoreData. The views should be updated via a fetched results controller.

     *  I have used constructor injection, it seems a bit clunky. Anyway...
